# MyMemory

### Description:

*Programming silly games is a great way to hone your programming skills!*\
Here's one of mine.\
Since I like to travel a lot, I made a Memory game with my own pictures.


### Languages used:

HTML, CSS and lots of JavaScript


### What I learned from this project:

* To create elements in JavaScript and push them to a CSS grid
* practicing to write JavaScript functions and loops.
* writing game-logic

### Features that I want to add:

* the possibility to choose your own difficulty-setting (ranging form 8 to 20 cards)
* the possibility to upload your own pictures (as requested by family-members!)
